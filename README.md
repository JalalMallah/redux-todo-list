# Todo List with Redux

[Live Preview](https://tackle-the-day.netlify.app/) ðŸš€

> This is a playground project that I created while learning Redux. It's a simple todo list application which fetches 5 todo items from JSONPlaceholder API on page load and also enables the User to add his own todo items and also to remove any of them from the todo list. It was necessary to implement redux-thunk in order to make async API calls to fetch the data.

### Tech Stack

- React
- Redux (with redux-thunk)
- CSS Modules
- JSONPlaceholder API
- Netlify (Deployment)
